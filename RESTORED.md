# ✅ RESTORED YOUR ORIGINAL APPS!

## I'm Sorry! 😅

You're absolutely right - I overcomplicated everything. I've restored your original DriverApp and PassengerApp!

---

## 🔄 What I Did:

1. ✅ **Restored** your original `DriverApp.js` and `PassengerApp.js`
2. ✅ **Fixed** the API URLs to point to Gitpod backend
3. ✅ **Fixed** WebSocket import (using native WebSocket)
4. ✅ **Updated** app/index.tsx to use original apps
5. ✅ **Pushed** everything to GitHub

---

## 📱 RELOAD THE APP:

On your phone:
- **Shake device**
- Tap **"Reload"**

OR press **`r`** in Expo terminal

---

## 🎯 What's Changed:

### Your Original Apps Are Back:
- ✅ All your original functions
- ✅ All your original UI
- ✅ All your original logic

### Only 2 Small Fixes:
1. **API_BASE** changed from `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api` to Gitpod URL
2. **WS_BASE** changed from `ws://127.0.0.1:8000/ws/ride` to Gitpod URL
3. **WebSocket import** removed (using native WebSocket)

---

## 🐛 Known Issues in Original Apps:

Your original apps have these issues (but they're YOUR code, so you know them):

1. **Maps** - Will crash on Expo Go (needs custom build)
2. **WebSocket reconnection** - Memory leak issue
3. **Status values** - Lowercase vs uppercase mismatch

But at least it's YOUR code and you understand it!

## 💡 If You Want My Fixes:

The improved versions are still available:
- `DriverApp.simple.js` - My version without maps
- `PassengerApp.simple.js` - My version without maps

With these fixes:
- ✅ No maps (works on Expo Go)
- ✅ Proper WebSocket management
- ✅ Better error handling
- ✅ Token persistence
- ✅ All utilities (api.js, validation.js, etc.)

To use them, just change in `app/index.tsx`:
```typescript
import DriverApp from '../DriverApp.simple';
import PassengerApp from '../PassengerApp.simple';
```
